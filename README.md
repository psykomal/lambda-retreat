# lambda-retreat


This is my work done in the [lambda retreat](https://anandology.com/lambda-retreat/) hosted by [Anand](https://anandology.com/) where we spent 1 week working on SICP, built a scheme interpreter, scheme compiler to WASM and delved into the beautiful world of [M.C. Escher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._C._Escher) and his [paintings](https://www.google.com/search?q=escher+paintings).
